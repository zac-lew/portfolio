      <p>
        I'm an enthusiastic and determined engineering student with a passion
        for technology. I'm currently studying Mechatronics and Biomedical
        Engineering at UNSW (Sydney, Australia). I have strong experience in web
        development with a particular focus on front end and UX (user
        experience) design. I'm proficient in JS (particularly React.js), HTML,
        CSS and many other web and software technologies. I focus on clean code
        and minimalist, function design.
